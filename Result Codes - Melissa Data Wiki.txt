|
 Box Closed
|
 A COA was found. The Post Box was closed with no order filed by the customer (BCNO).
|@
 
 CM05
|
 Cannot Match Secondary
|
 The COA could not be matched because the street address does not match with the secondary number.
|@
 
 CM06
|
 DPBC Ambiguous
|
 The COA could not be converted to a deliverable address because the 11-digit zip code represents more than one delivery point.
|@
 
 CM07
|
 Conflicting Middle Name
|
 The COA could not be matched because there is more than one COA record for the match and the middle names or initials on the COAs are different.
|@
 
 CM08
|
 Conflicting Gender
|
 The COA could not be matched because there is more than one COA record for the match and the genders of the names on the COAs are different.
|@
 
 CM09
|
 Conflicting Instructions
|
 The COA could not be matched because two potential matches were compared and had differences in the new addresses.
|@
 
 CM10
|
 Cannot Match High-rise Default
|
 The COA could not be matched because the input record is a potential match to a family COA record from a multi-unit building, but the address zip + 4 coded to the building default. This requires individual name matching logic to obtain a match and the individual names did not match.
|@
 
 CM11
|
 Cannot Match Rural Default
|
 The COA could not be matched because the input record is a potential match to a family COA record from a Rural Route or Highway Contract Route address. This requires individual name matching logic to obtain a match and the individual names did not match.
|@
 
 CM12
|
 Insufficient Name
|
 The COA could not be matched because there is a COA record with the same surname and address but there is insufficient first/middle name information on the COA record to product a match using individual matching logic.
|@
 
 CM13
|
 Middle Name Test Failed
|
 The COA could not be matched because the input name contains a conflict with the middle name or initials on the COA record.
|@
 
 CM14
|
 Gender Conflict
|
 The COA could not be matched because the gender of the name on the input record conflicts with the gender of the name on the COA record.
|@
 
 CM15
|
 Cannot Convert Address
|
 The COA was found but the new address would not convert at run time.
|@
 
 CM16
|
 Individual Name Insufficient
|
 The COA could not be matched because the input middle initial/name is missing or does not equal the middle initial/name on the potential COA match.
|@
 
 CM17
|
 Secondary Discrepancy
|
 The COA could not be matched because there is conflicting secondary information on the input and COA record or the input record contained secondary information and matched to a family record that does not contain secondary information.
|@
 
 CM18
|
 Other Insufficient Name
|
 The COA could not be matched because the input middle initial/name is missing or different from the middle name on the COA. A match cannot be made because the first name on the COA was truncated and the middle names must be equal in order to make this match.
|@
 
 CM19
|
 Cannot Match General Delivery
|
 The COA could not be matched for general delivery.
|@
 
 CM20
|
 No ZIP + 4,  Not Confirmable, or Temporary
|
 The COA was found but the new address either: does not have a ZIP+4 coded and therefore there is no 11-digit DPBC, the primary number cannot be confirmed on DPV, or is temporary.
|@
 
 CM21
|
 Conflicting Directions
|
 The address could not be updated due to multiple matches.
|@
 
 CM22
|
 Input Missing Suite
|
 Input address missing suite data. Can still be matched.
|@
 
 CM23
|
 Secondary Dropped from Input
|
 The secondary number was dropped from the input address.
